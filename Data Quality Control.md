Data Quality Control

Project Description

This project focuses on monitoring and controlling data quality in an AWS environment using AWS CloudWatch, AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS), and AWS Glue. By implementing key monitoring metrics and real-time notifications, the system ensures data integrity, performance optimization, and efficient storage management.

Project Title

Implementation of Data Quality Control Using AWS CloudWatch and SNS

Objective

The objective of this project is to establish a robust data monitoring and controlling mechanism to:

Ensure data storage efficiency.

Monitor AWS Glue job performance.

Detect anomalies and prevent storage abuse.

Enable real-time notifications for system responsiveness.

Dataset

The dataset is stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

Data includes various structured and unstructured files utilized for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing.

AWS Glue processes these datasets for transformation and analysis.

Methodology

1. Data Collection and Preparation

Data is ingested into an S3 bucket where monitoring is applied.

AWS Glue ETL jobs process and transform raw data.

Monitoring mechanisms track storage utilization and processing performance.

2. Descriptive Statistics

Monitored key metrics:

Bucket Size: Ensuring it does not exceed 40KB in the unprocessed region.

Number of Duplicate Objects: Limiting duplicate files to a threshold of 8.

AWS Glue Job Execution Time: Evaluating performance slowdowns by setting a reference threshold at 1%.

3. Data Visualization

AWS CloudWatch dashboard is used to track and visualize real-time metrics.

Graphs and charts display bucket size, object duplication, and ETL execution time trends.

Alarms provide insights into system performance.

4. Survival Analysis

Implemented real-time monitoring to detect potential failures.

Established CloudWatch alarms that trigger notifications when predefined thresholds are crossed.

Ensured proactive action to maintain system efficiency and avoid bottlenecks.

5. Insights and Findings

Improved Governance: Real-time monitoring reduced data inconsistencies.

Optimized Cost Management: Avoided excessive storage consumption and redundant processing.

Enhanced Performance: Identified slowdowns in ETL jobs and streamlined data processing.

6. Conclusion

Implementing AWS CloudWatch and SNS improved overall data quality control.

CloudWatch alarms enabled real-time response to storage and processing anomalies.

The combination of monitoring and notifications ensures better data governance and cost efficiency.

Tools and Technologies

AWS CloudWatch: Monitoring and dashboard visualization.

AWS SNS: Real-time notifications for threshold breaches.

AWS Glue: ETL job monitoring and performance tracking.
